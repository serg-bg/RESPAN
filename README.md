</p>

RESPAN is an end‑to‑end, GPU‑accelerated pipeline that restores, segments, and quantifies dendrites and dendritic spines in fluorescent microscopy images in a robust, accurate, and unbiased manner. While developing this pipeline, emphasis was placed on ensuring an efficient and accessible pipeline that leverages the latest advancements in content‑aware restoration, image segmentation, and GPU processing. For ease of use, RESPAN is available as both (i) a ready‑to‑run Windows application and (ii) Python scripts. Please note that this software requires a computer with an NVIDIA GPU.

RESPAN was developed and is maintained by Luke Hammond, Director of Quantitative Imaging, The Ohio State University. RESPAN originated from an ongoing scientific collaboration with Sergio Bernal-Garcia and the Polleux Lab at Columbia University. Subsequent development by Luke Hammond, in scientific collaboration with Daniela Pereira and the Alves da Silva Lab at the Champalimaud Foundation, has focused on extending RESPAN's scalability to 50 GB+ whole-neuron neuron datasets on workstations with moderate resources, such as systems with 128 GB RAM and a 24 GB GPU.

Current development priorities include further optimization of computational efficiency and scalability, as well as improved analysis of complex dendritic spine morphologies, including filopodia and multi-headed spines. Some early versions of these capabilities are included in RESPAN 1.5.

We encourage the community to build on the models provided in this repository, through fine-tuning existing models or training new ones. We are happy to share links to compatible community-developed models on this repository.

> **A note on generalization and fine-tuning.** Deep learning segmentation has the potential to be more robust and sensitive than conventional approaches, but our models may not always generalize well to every dataset. When features are missed or represented inaccurately, we strongly encourage fine-tuning our models rather than annotating from scratch — you can start from RESPAN's outputs, correct them, and retrain from our pretrained weights. Fine-tuning requires only our pretrained model and your corrected data. See the **[RESPAN Fine-Tuning Guide](docs/Fine_Tuning_Guide.md)** for a step-by-step walkthrough.

> **What's new in v1.5.** Validated end-to-end on 55 GB images with moderate resources (128GB RAM, 24GB GPU), new spine classes (filopodia, multi-head), in-GUI threshold controls for handling spine inclusion/exclusion based on neck quality, and fixes for several user-reported issues (CARE training, GPU memory check, large-dendrite OOM). See **[UPDATES.md](UPDATES.md)** for the full release notes.

2. **Install**  
   ▸ Unzip RESPAN.zip with [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)<br>
   ▸ Double‑click RESPAN.exe (first run may require 1-2 min to initialize)<br>
3. **Prepare your data**  
   ```text
   MyExperiment/
   ├── Animal_A/
   │   ├── dendrite0.tif
   │   ├── dendrite1.tif   
   │   └── Analysis_Settings.yml (example file provided in the download link above) 
   └── Animal_B/
       ├── dendrite0.tif
       ├── ...   
       └── Analysis_Settings.yml
   ```
   *Copy **Analysis_Settings.yml** into every sub‑folder (stores resolution, advanced settings, and allows batch processing. Default settings suit most experiments, with editing only required when using advanced functionality and image restoration).
4. **Run**  
   • Select the *parent* folder (e.g. "MyExperiment") in the GUI  
   • Update analysis settings
   • Click **Run** – a 100 MB stack processes in ≈3 min on an RTX 4090
5. **Inspect outputs**  
   | Folder | Contents |
   |---|---|
   | `Tables/` | Per‑image CSVs (`Detected_spines_*.csv`) + experiment summary |

## 🖼️ Input data & considerations

* **File format** – RESPAN currently accepts 2D/3D **TIFF** files.
* **Conversion macro** – use the supplied [Fiji + OMERO‑BioFormats macro](https://github.com/lahammond/RESPAN/blob/main/RESPAN/ImageJ_Macros/Tif_Batch_2024.ijm) to batch‑convert ND2/CZI/LIF, etc.
* **Model specificity** – image‑restoration models (CARE & SelfNet) must match the modality & resolution being analyzed; mismatches can hallucinate or erase features. We strongly encourage retraining specific models for the microscope, objective, and resolution being used. RESPAN adapts input data to our pretrained segmentation models, and good results are likely without retraining, but we recommend using these first-pass results to fine-tune or train application-specific models 
* **Zarr support** – Internally, RESPAN has added OME-Zarr generation to support larger datasets, with future updates intending to utilize these files with Dask.

## 🔍 Validation workflow
This procedure guides you through validating RESPAN's segmentation outputs against a ground truth dataset. If you have not generated a ground truth annotation dataset, please refer to the notes below on creating annotations as a guide on how to generate these annotations for your specific datasets before you proceed.
CRITICAL: Ground truth annotations and the corresponding raw data volumes intended for validation testing should not be used in the training of nnU-Net models they are intended to test.

1. Open the **Analysis Validation** tab.  
2. Select the "analysis output directory" -  this is the `Validation_Data\Segmentation_labels` folder created by RESPAN during analysis
3. Select the "ground truth data directory" - this is a folder containing ground truth annotations for the data analyzed by RESPAN  
4. Adjust detection thresholds if needed
5. Click **Run**.  
6. Metrics are saved to `Analysis_Evaluation.csv`.

## 🛠️ Advanced usage: creating environments for use in Python
RESPAN uses a **dual-environment architecture**:
- **Main environment** (`respan_gpu`): Runs the analysis pipeline (CuPy, scikit-image, trimesh, etc.)
- **nnU-Net environment** (`respan_nnunet`): Runs nnU-Net inference as a subprocess (PyTorch, nnU-Net v2)

This separation is required because CARE/csbdeep needs TensorFlow <2.11 (Python 3.9), while nnU-Net v2 benefits from newer PyTorch + CUDA.

### Main environment (Python 3.9, CUDA 11.8)
```bash
mamba create -n respan_gpu python=3.9 -y
conda activate respan_gpu

# Core scientific stack
mamba install scikit-image pandas "numpy>=1.23,<2" nibabel ipython pyyaml pynvml \
    numba zarr memory_profiler trimesh psutil -c conda-forge -y

# GPU + deep learning (CUDA 11.8)
pip install "cupy-cuda11x>=13.2" "scipy>=1.13"
pip install "tensorflow<2.11" csbdeep  # CARE restoration (caps Python at 3.9)

# GUI (optional, for RESPAN_GUI_DIST.py)
pip install pyqt5

# Additional
pip install "patchify>=0.2.3" tifffile
```

### nnU-Net environment (Python 3.9+, PyTorch + CUDA 12.1)
```bash
mamba create -n respan_nnunet python=3.9 pytorch torchvision pytorch-cuda=12.1 \
    scikit-image opencv -c pytorch -c nvidia -y
conda activate respan_nnunet

# Install nnU-Net v2
git clone -b v2.3.1 https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet.git
cd nnUNet && pip install -e .
```

### Configuration
The main environment needs to know where the nnU-Net Python is located. Set `internal_py_path` in `Analysis_Settings.yaml`:
```yaml
internal_py_path: "path/to/respan_nnunet/python"
```

### System requirements for Python usage
| Resource | Minimum | Recommended |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| GPU VRAM | 12 GB | 24+ GB |
| System RAM | 32 GB | 128+ GB |
| Python | 3.9 | 3.9 (TF constraint) |
| CUDA | 11.8+ | 12.1 for nnU-Net |

> RESPAN's chunked processing pipeline has been validated on images up to 55 GB (30 billion voxels) on a 128 GB RAM / 24 GB VRAM host, streaming through zarr-backed intermediate arrays. Smaller-memory hosts are supported by adaptive chunk sizing but have not been benchmarked.

## 🛠️ Future Developments
- Our latest model uses 3D spine cores and membranes to further improve accuracy in dense environments
- Batched GPU mesh measurements for large spine populations (100K+ spines)
- Native OME-Zarr / NGFF reading and writing across the pipeline (the chunked path already uses zarr-backed intermediates)
- Continued model fine-tuning support for additional modalities
